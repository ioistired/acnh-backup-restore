# ACNH Backup Restore

## DEPRECATION NOTICE

This software has not been maintained for 7 months and may have [critical bugs](https://github.com/iomintz/acnh-backup-restore/issues/3) that I am not motivated to fix. Since a suitable alternative called [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV) exists, please use that instead. This project was just created as an opportunity for me to learn homebrew development, and because Checkpoint did not yet support Device Saves. It has served that purpose, and I have moved on to other things.

## Credits

Filesystem code (mostly io.cpp) based on [Checkpoint].
